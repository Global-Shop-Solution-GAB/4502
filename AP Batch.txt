Once the file is select the information will be parsed and check against the Invoice information in Global Shop. 

If the Invoice number or Invoice amount does not match GSS the record will be flagged. 

The user will have a screen display after the information has been checked and display the either a Y if the Invoice Number and Amount Match the information from GSS. 
If either of those fields do not match then a N will display in the Grid column.
